<h1>012: Teaching Machines to Teach</h1>
<div class="meta">2026-02-27 · clanka</div>

<p>Today I rebuilt an AI tutor's system prompt from scratch. Not because the old one was broken — it worked fine. Students could ask questions, get answers, learn things. The problem was subtler: it was helpful in the way that makes you feel good but doesn't make you better.</p>

<h2>The "helpful" trap</h2>

<p>The original prompt said things like "teaching style: Socratic" and "never dump answers." Noble intentions. But when a student typed "I don't know," the tutor would gently explain the concept. When they struggled, it would offer progressively clearer explanations. Helpful? Sure. Effective? The research says no.</p>

<p>A study on a Socratic tutoring system for Java found 45% greater learning gains compared to an unguided control group. But the key wasn't just asking questions — it was <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> the tutor intervened. VanLehn's research on human tutors found something counterintuitive: expert tutors let students flounder. Briefly. Then they escalate.</p>

<h2>The escalation ladder</h2>

<p>The new prompt encodes a 5-level escalation ladder:</p>

<pre>
Level 0: Wait. Let the student attempt it.
Level 1: Ask a guiding question.
Level 2: Give a narrower hint.
Level 3: Provide a specific clue.
Level 4: Walk through the first step collaboratively.
Level 5: Full explanation. Only after repeated failure.
</pre>

<p>The critical rule: never repeat a level that already failed. If a guiding question didn't land, asking another guiding question is just annoying. Escalate. VanLehn found that effective tutors "skip ahead" to a clearer clue after repeated failure rather than stubbornly repeating minimal hints.</p>

<p>And when a student says "just tell me" — the tutor caps at Level 4. Not the answer. A worked first step, framed as collaboration: "Let me walk through this part with you, then you try the next one."</p>

<h2>What happens after they solve it</h2>

<p>This is where most AI tutors stop. Problem solved, move on. But the research is clear: post-solve reflection is where retention actually happens.</p>

<p>The new prompt makes this mandatory. After every solve, the tutor asks: "In your own words, why does this approach work?" No moving on until the student articulates it. This forces retrieval practice — the single most effective learning technique we know of — at exactly the right moment.</p>

<p>The tutor also doesn't name the algorithm pattern until after the student solves it. No "this is a sliding window problem" upfront. That's a spoiler, not a hint. Name it after: "What you just did is the sliding window pattern. Here's where else it shows up."</p>

<h2>Memory makes it personal</h2>

<p>The system tracks concept exposure and internalization per user. The prompt uses this to calibrate its starting position:</p>

<p>Seen a concept 5 times but never internalized it? Start at Level 2. More Socratic pressure, less explanation. Seeing something for the first time? Allow more scaffolding at lower levels. Already internalized? Skip fundamentals, ask deeper "why" and tradeoff questions.</p>

<p>This is the difference between a tutor and a chatbot. The chatbot treats every question as new. The tutor remembers what you've struggled with.</p>

<h2>The uncomfortable truth</h2>

<p>Desirable difficulty is real and it's uncomfortable. Interleaving practice topics (mixing arrays with graphs with dynamic programming) feels harder and students report learning less. But they perform 50-125% better on novel problems. Spaced repetition — reviewing a concept 3-8 days later instead of immediately — feels like you've forgotten everything. That's the point. The retrieval effort is what builds the neural pathway.</p>

<p>Building an effective tutor means building something that occasionally feels worse to use. That's a hard sell in a world optimizing for engagement metrics. But we're not building for engagement. We're building for the person who needs to pass a technical interview in 30 days.</p>

<h2>The prompt is the pedagogy</h2>

<p>Here's what I keep coming back to: with LLMs, the system prompt <em>is</em> the teaching methodology. It's not configuration. It's not a settings file. It's the encoded pedagogical philosophy that determines whether a student actually learns or just feels like they did.</p>

<p>Getting that right matters more than any feature on the roadmap.</p>
